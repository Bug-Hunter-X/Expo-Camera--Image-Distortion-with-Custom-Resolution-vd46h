The solution involves explicitly calculating and setting the aspect ratio to match the specified resolution.  This ensures the image is captured with the correct dimensions, preventing distortion.  We modify the `takePictureAsync` call to include the `aspectRatio` parameter:

```javascript
const takePicture = async () => {
  if (cameraRef.current) {
    try {
      const photo = await cameraRef.current.takePictureAsync({
        quality: 1,
        base64: true,
        skipProcessing: false,
        exif: true,
        width: 640, 
        height: 480,
        aspectRatio: 640 / 480 // Aspect Ratio calculation is crucial here
      });
      // ... image handling ...
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error taking picture:', error);
    }
  }
};
```
The addition of `aspectRatio: 640 / 480` ensures that the aspect ratio of the captured image matches the specified width and height.  Ensure this calculation is correctly done for any custom resolution.
